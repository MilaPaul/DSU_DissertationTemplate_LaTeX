\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

Acknowledgments are optional. If included, please consider the following general guidelines for acknowledging contributions to your project:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is the responsibility of a student to acknowledge sources of his or her ideas and information. For example, if a student publishes a paper written for a particular professor, that individual should be acknowledged.

\item The significant contribution of any individual or group to a published work should be acknowledged within that work, by inclusion of the name of the individual or the group and, if appropriate, by a brief identification of the nature of the contribution. This recognition may be in the form of an acknowledgment in the body of the work, or in a prominent footnote. 

\item When possible, the nature of the acknowledgment should be agreed upon in writing by the contributor and principal author, prior to submission of the work for publication. If there is to be remuneration for a publication, those who contributed significantly to the work should be so informed and a contractual agreement reached prior to publication concerning the distribution of the compensation.

\item Acknowledging the support of family and friends

\item Acknowledgments should not extend more than one page.
